# Goal Setting

## The Goal

I can't see how to access the smart goal I submitted, but it was along the lines of:

>Improve confidence in using debugging processes by using debugging for each failing test 
and recording how this went after testing each class. 

If this is the case, then I need to make an edit and record the process
after each user story. This is because I am only writing the tests required
for the user story I am currently working on. 

## After User Story 1

I did not perform any debugging during these tests. This was because
I had forgotten that I had set the goal. 

## After User Story 2

I started debugging after writing each failing test. The tests were all
trivial, but it was useful to get familiar with the interface. 

## After User Story 3

This User Story was essentially the same as the above - However, it involved two tests which
were slightly more complex as they involved regex. The debugging here was useful, and I set a watch value
on the results of matching to the expressions.
