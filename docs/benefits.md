# The Benefits of this software

## Introduction

In this document we will consider why this Address Book software is needed
and the benefits that it will bring to DFCorp and your customers.

## The problem this software solves

We communicate with a variety of contacts, and for each contact we may have multiple
methods of contact, for instance phone numbers and email addresses. Accordingly,
we will all have a large amount of contact data.

One method of recording and organising this contact data is through a paper-based address book.
However, this means of storing contacts can become messy. For example, if we wanted to update
a contact’s details, we may need to scribble out an old phone number and insert a new one.
If this update spills over to a new page, and the next page is already occupied, a contact’s data may
need to be fragmented in the address book or even multiple address books.

In addition, tasks like searching for a contact are very cumbersome using a paper-based system.
Many address books will have separate sections for each alphabetic character. But, if we have lots of
people whose name starts with an ‘A’, we may need to use multiple address books to store our contacts.
Conversely, if there are few people whose name starts with ‘B’ We may have lots of blank pages in the ‘B’
section of our address book. 

## Benefits for your customers

This software provides a variety of benefits. We will consider just a few of these here:

- Keep contact data organised
- All contact data in one place
- Quickly find a contact’s details

### Keep contact data organised

As noted above, it can be difficult to organise contact data using a paper-based system.
This software removes the problems outlined above. Customers can add, update and delete contact
data through an easy-to-use user interface (UI). 

This software will keep this data organised and allow users to easily view, and access contact
data. 

There are also protections to help detect and prevent data entry errors. For instance,
a given phone number or email address may only be associated with a single contact.

### All contact data in one place

We have seen that with a paper-based system, contact data may need to be split across
multiple address books. With this software, customers can store all their contacts in a
single place. 

Currently, this software is not integrated with other services, for example a contact list
on a phone, email software or accounting software. However, future development could add such
integration to truly provide a single point for contact data management. 

### Quickly find a contact’s details

While a paper-based system can provide limited alphabetic organisation, this software is much more
sophisticated. Users can search their contact list for contacts matching a given search term to quickly
filter and find the contact they are looking for. 

## Benefits for DFCorp

Next, we will consider a few of the benefits that this software can offer to DFCorp:

- Diversified product range
- Build public visibility
- Build public reputation

### Diversified product range

The Secret Diary has been tremendously successful, however, a significant proportion of DFCorp’s revenue is
coming from this one product. If revenue decreases for the Secret Diary, for instance, due to a strong competitor
product being released, this could significantly detriment the business. 

Adding the Address Book software to your products provides a dampener between the performance of any one product
and the performance of the business. 

### Build public visibility

With a wider variety of products, you will be visible to a wider audience. Customers searching for
Address Book software may stumble on DFCorp. This will bring your brand, and the full range of products
you offer, to their attention. 

### Build public reputation

This is robust software built with a test-driven approach. The user interface has been designed to be
intuitive and easy to use. Accordingly, customers using this software will associate DFCorp with quality.
This will increase the reputation of DFCorp. 

There is a risk that poor quality software will damage the reputation of DFCorp. However, we are
aware of this risk and have taken great care when designing and building this software.
